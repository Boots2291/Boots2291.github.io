      <h4>First Post: Looking Back at Mod 1</h4>
      <h5>
        Module 1 at Turing was quite an eye opener for me. I proved to myself that
        even though I figured out that I had a fixed mindset, I could change that.
        The program is designed in a way that really allows the student to adapt to
        a different way of thinking. It is hard to believe that in only six weeks I have
        learned as much about Ruby programming that I have. I really enjoyed being a
        student at Turing these past six weeks.<br /><br />My favorite technical concept
        introduced was Object Relational Mapping. I thought that the project Black
        Thursday was a very interesting change from the data structures that we had
        been building. I thought that having us build an ORM gave us a really good
        look into how components that we will be working with actually work. That
        project also allowed us to show what we understand about refactoring. I found
        many opportunities to use modules to hide delegates. Overall, that project
        really solidified my high level understanding of how an ORM allows us to interact
        with different types of data.
